#This module is for advanced feature that i've been thinking about.
#No need to do this right now.
#The basic idea of this module is to generate some network traffic
#to simulate the actual one, and analyze the behavior of this traffic,
#so that we can identify dangerous before the user send actual meaningful
#network traffic.
